This design corrects many of the issues I had with MK-II
It is also designed as a prototype board.
This one is covered in indication LEDS and matched switches so you can see what rails are doing what.

This board does NOT need the late stage LNAs as there are digital signals comming out, these don't need the.
I have further improved the design, however this one did not make it futher than this drawing stage.
