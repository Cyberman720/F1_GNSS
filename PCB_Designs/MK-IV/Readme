The mark iV design is a building off of the work done on MK-III.
This iteration brings the board closer to the EVAL kit and uses a lot of the lessons from:
https://github.com/psas/gps-rf-board/blob/master/

I have modified my RF front end to match theirs as frankly RF is witchcraft.
Then I have improved my layout of the MAX2769 to include counters as present in the EVAL and this kit.

MK-IV has passed the impedance calibration test.
This means that we have a greenlight to go to build for a batch of these units as th design is sound.

These designs are built for JLCPCB's JLC04161H-7628 stack up, this gives 50ohms between the signal layer and the ground plane.
