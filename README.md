# F1_GNSS
Repo for developing the F1_Engine
The objective of this project is to develop a basic L1 GPS only receiver.

The steps are as follows:
  learn how the basics of GNSS and specifically GPS work from a theroy aspect.
    https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/91829/cdma-using-bpsk-demodulation
  
  prototype a GNSS siluation program in python.
    This has been an amazing resource for this:

  Intergrate with arduino

  determine if I can run the engine direct on the arduino or if i need to process things on an external Rasberry pi
