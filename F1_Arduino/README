I have been using an ARDUINO R4 wifi for my actual front end.
This board enables me to read the I/Q values off my board and do things with them.
To power the board, plug into serial and plug the RF into 5v an ground (as the voltage regluator will bring it to a stable 3.3v)


I have the LED matrix programmed as such:

0,
1,
2,
3, LD
4, I0 
5, I1
6, Q0
7, Q1

each of these bars will go from one end to the other.
one light means the  channel is "LOW"
Multiple means the channel is "High"

From here, the board outputs over serial.
